# ITML
Voice Recognition System
this is a slightly edited version of the file that Malgorzata uploaded to the onedrive.
first cell is a pip install cell in case some of the libraries used are missing
the audio_fpath is where the original sound files should be located before turning them into spectrograms
image_path is where the spectrograms will be generated and used in the model(or where you keep the previously generated spectrograms by Malgorzata)
